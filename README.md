# Data-In-Motion-Python-Challenge
This repository contains solutions of the problems given in Data in Motion weekly python challenge.
Each folder will contain problems for each week. Each problem will contain a problem statement along with the code solution.
I intentionally skipped the first 30 weeks as the problems were suitable for the complete beginners. I only attempted the problems that I considered something interesting or will teach me something. Otherwise I skipped the week or the problem.
