# Hard 1
    # Create a function that takes in two words as input 
    # and returns a list of three elements, in the following order:

    # Shared letters between two words. 
    # Letters unique to word 1. 
    # Letters unique to word 2. 
    # Each element should have unique letters, 
    # and have each letter be alphabetically sorted.
    
# Examples

# letters(“sharp”, “soap”) ➞ [“aps”, “hr”, “o”]

# letters(“board”, “bored”) ➞ [“bdor”, “a”, “e”]

# letters(“happiness”, “envelope”) ➞ [“enp”, “ahis”, “lov”]

# letters(“kerfuffle”, “fluffy”) ➞ [“flu”, “ekr”, “y”]

# letters(“match”, “ham”) ➞ [“ahm”, “ct”, “”]
